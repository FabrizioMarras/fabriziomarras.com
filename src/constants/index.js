As first step towards the client needs, I designed and created 3 icons which symbolise the company name and vision: 1) the speech bubble indicating their aim to bring the client toward more confident and highly skilled speaking, 2) the horse - already present in their logo - used as symbol for business leaders, and 3) the chess pattern piece symbolising the strategic learning experience.
